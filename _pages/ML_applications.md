This tutorial was designed and taught in **Summer 2024**, attended by both graduate and undergraduate students. It introduced core machine learning concepts and emphasized hands-on experience with real-world workflows, including data preprocessing, model selection, and application development.

The course also covered fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for specific downstream tasks and building LLM-based applications, such as ChatPDF, using tools like BERT and LangChain. Students used Python-based frameworks to implement practical solutions and gain a deeper understanding of applied machine learning and generative AI techniques.
