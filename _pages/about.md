I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Meng Jiang](http://www.meng-jiang.com/). Before that, I received my bachelor degree of Computer Science and Technology at [Sichuan University](http://www.scu.edu.cn/).

My research interest lies in natural language processing (NLP). Specifically, I am working on Reasoning on behaviorial intention indentification, natural lanuage generation (NLG), complex question answering system.
