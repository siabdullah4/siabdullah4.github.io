I am a first-year (2022-now) Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the [University of Louisiana at Lafayette](https://louisiana.edu/), and have the fortune to be advised by [Prof. Li Chen](https://lichenut.github.io/). Before that, I received my bachelor degree of Computer Science and Technology at [Rajshahi University of Engineering and Engineering](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ruet.ac.bd%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw05hBgdsiEuv4pq-h83lt0A) in 2017. I have more than four years of working experience in different companies.

My primary research interest lies in deep learning and machine learning. Currently, I am working on tackling data heterogeneity problem in Federated Learning.


**I am actively looking for a Summer-2023 internship related to Data Science, Machine Learning, and Software engineering field.**
