I am a first-year (2022-now) Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the [University of Louisiana at Lafayette](https://louisiana.edu/), and have the fortune to be advised by [Prof. Li Chen](https://lichenut.github.io/). Before that, I received my bachelor degree of Computer Science and Technology at [Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ruet.ac.bd%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw05hBgdsiEuv4pq-h83lt0A) in 2017.

My primary research interest lies in deep learning and machine learning. 


**I am seeking NLP postdoc (or equivalent) and research scientist roles in the job market, and I expect to graduate by the end of 2023 (or anytime in 2024 is also acceptable for me).**
