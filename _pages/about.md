I am a third-year (2019-Now) Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Meng Jiang](http://www.meng-jiang.com/). Before that, I received my bachelor degree of Computer Science and Technology at [Sichuan University](http://www.scu.edu.cn/).

My research interest lies in natural language processing (NLP). Specifically, I am working on natural lanuage generation (NLG) and complex question answering (QA) system. Besides, I am also interested in language model pre-training and domain adaptation.

What's New
======

* \[2021.12\] Our tutorial entitled **Knowledge-Augmented Methods for Natural Language Processing** is accepted to [ACL 2022](https://www.2022.aclweb.org/), collaborating with Chenguang Zhu, Yichong Xu from Microsoft Research, and Xiang Ren, Yuchen Lin from USC. See you in Dublin in May 2022!
* \[2021.12\] We have presented a tutorial on **Knowledge-enriched Natural Language Generation** at [EMNLP 2021](https://2021.emnlp.org/). There were more than 95 online and 25 in-person participants. The tutorial materials are all available online. \[[Abstract](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-tutorials.3/)\] \[[Video](https://underline.io/events/192/sessions?eventSessionId=7843)\] \[[Website](https://kenlg-tutorial.github.io/)\] \[[Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04389)\] \[[GitRepo](https://github.com/wyu97/KENLG-Reading)\]. Thanks very much to my collaborators (Prof. Heng Ji from UIUC, Prof. Zhiting Hu from UCSD, Dr. Nazneen Rajani from Saleforce research)!
