I am a third-year (2022-now) Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, and have the fortune to be advised by [Prof. Li Chen](https://lichenut.github.io/). Before that, I received my bachelor degree of Computer Science and Technology at Rajshahi University of Engineering and Engineering in 2017. I have more than four years of working experience in different companies.

My primary research interest lies in Federated Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI. I am particularly interested in developing communication-efficient federated learning algorithms to solve heterogeneous problems in real-world applications.

**I am actively looking for a Summer 2025 internship related to Data Science, Machine Learning, and Software engineering field. Please kindly find my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SJSCWHs-YaLSkBPesrCySecK7BXYebee/view?usp=sharing).**
