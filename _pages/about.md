I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Meng Jiang](http://www.meng-jiang.com/). Before that, I received my bachelor degree of Computer Science and Technology at [Sichuan University](http://www.scu.edu.cn/).

My research interest lies in graph-based machine learning and natural language processing. Specifically, I am working on Reasoning on Behaviorial Intention Indentification, Natural Text Generation, Complex Question Answering System.
