I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate (2022-present) in Computer Science at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and have the fortune to be advised by [Prof. Li Chen](https://lichenut.github.io/). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology in 2017. I have over four years of work experience in various companies.

My primary research interest lies in Federated Learning, AI/ML Security and Privacy, Edge Computing, and Generative AI. I am particularly interested in developing communication-efficient federated learning algorithms to solve heterogeneous problems in real-world applications.
